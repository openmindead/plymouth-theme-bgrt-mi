# plymouth-theme-bgrt-mi
A Plymouth theme based on BGRT &amp; Spinner themes, but featuring Xiaomi progress bar

Arch and Manjaro users: download both files or clone this branch and run `makepkg -i` to build a package.

This theme has Manjaro branding by default so Arch guys might prefer to do `sudo cp /usr/share/plymouth/arch-logo.png /usr/share/plymouth/themes/bgrt-mi/watermark.png` first.
Then issue `sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R bgrt-mi` and you are good to go.
